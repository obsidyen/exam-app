# exam-app - Exam date reminder app for Android Phones

This project was my entry to software developing.  
Project was written in Java via Android Studio and most of the variable names are in Turkish.
Started in May 2019, I've started on my self-learning journey with Udemy course from Kasım Adalan. After 3 months on learning the basics, I needed to go away from tutorial hell and decided to create an app for real.  
Exam app was first to came into my mind, mainly because there were close to none competitors in Play Store, so I delved into it.  
This exam app is not about the exams on school. But on national scale.  
In Turkey there are lots of national exams for example, to get into high school, university, public institutions etc. you need to succeed in LGS(Liseye Giriş Sınavı - Exam for High School Entry), YKS(Yükseköğretim Kurumları Sınavı - Higher Education Institutions Exam), KPSS (Kamu Personeli Seçme Sınavı - Public Personnel Selection Exam) respectively. This list goes on and on. (There are over 20-30 different one)  
Keeping track on all of them are a hassle, so I came up with that idea but...
After March 2020, I've abandoned this project because of COVID. All the schools are closed so there will be no more national exams. I've lost all my passion about this project.  
Before going into any further let's see what Exam app can do? 

## Features

Seeing all exam dates in application  
Keeping track of how much time left for exams  
Creating a list of favourite exams (To keep track of the exams that you are going to attempt)  
Seeing not only exam dates but application dates too  
Reminder notifications about how long left for exams

## Software Requirements

This app was written via Android Studio versions between 3.4 - 3.6  
Written via Java only. (Kotlin wasn't that cool back then)

## Closure

As I said in the introduction section, this project is abandoned.  
There are lots of half baked parts of app such as UI design (color scheme, button sizes etc.), there were supposed to be pictures baked into button background. Tons of more ideas.  
Maybe one day, I will return to this project but I guess Android Studio will crash whenever it starts to compile the gradle from that ancient version lol.  

Thanks COVID!
